# Project with multiple tools for GTM container evaluation and comparison

## Features

Analyse trigger, folders, tags and variables:
  * See renames
  * Deletions or additions
  * See moved items (except folders)
  * See changed triggers
  * See other fields differences (just the field name and values for now)

You can see a nice diffby clicking on the list of changed items, to see the actual values before and after, also the changed fields.   

### In progress

### Roadmap
* Allow users to select fields to ignore in the diff (since some fields are added as GTM version updates)
* Display separately 'created-removed' items -- items that are the same but changed IDs (fingerprint also changes).
